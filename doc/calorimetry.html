<p><b>Calorimetry lab</b>
<p>The calorimetry lab simulates determination of calorimeter constant and mesauring heat of decomposition or heat of solution.
<p><b>Setup</b>
<p>The Calorimetry menu has two options for two experiment setups.
<p>The first menu option is for determining the calorimeter constant.  The calorimeter constant is random and will change every time the program is started.  Choosing this option will set up the following:  When you click on the calorimeter flask, two equal volumes of water, 100 mL at 4 C and 100 mL at 20 C, are mixed.  The temperature will equilibrate over time.  The final temperature after mixing can be used to calculate the calorimter constant.
<p>The second menu option sets up to determine heat of dissociation (for hydrogen peroxide) or heat of solution (for several sulfate salts).  Add a specified amount of substance and check the box to dissolve in an amount of water.  Your lab manual should give details on experiment setup. 
<p><b>Running the experiment</b>
<p>Click on the calorimeter flask to start the experiment.  The bench turns green when the experiment is running.  While the exact time is random, neither experiment should take more than five minutes to reach final temperature.  Temperature is updated every ten seconds.
<p><b>Note:</b> In both experiments above, observe carefully!  Over extended time periods, the temeprature will slowly drift back toward room temperature (20 C)!
