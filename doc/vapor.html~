<p><b>Freezing point depression lab</b>
<p>The freezing point depression lab simulates dissolving substances in water and chilling in an ice/water/salt bath until freezing.
<p><b>Setup</b>
<p>The Freezing-Point menu provides two options.  The first option sets up the experiment.  Select the compound and mass to be used, and check the box to dissolve it in a given amount of water.  Your lab manual should have details on experiment setup.
<p>The second menu option sets the starting and target temperature.  These are preset, but this menu option must be selected prior to starting the experiment.
<p><b>Running the experiment</b>
<p>Click on the beaker to start the experiment.  The indicator on the
Chill-O-Matic(tm) pedestal will turn blue, indicating cooling is
occuring.  The temperature is decreased by 0.05 C per second, so
students will need to pay attention!  The freezing transition is set
to be obvious.  Clicking the beaker again stops time.
