<p><b>Vapor pressure lab</b>
<p>The extraction lab simulates the extraction of iodine from an aqueous solution using mineral oil.  The amount of iodine in the aqueous solution is monitored by absorbance.
<p><b>Setup</b>
<p>The Extraction menu provides one option: Extract.  Select this option to add mineral oil the beaker.  A dialog box will appear to allow the user to select the volume of mineral oil that will be put in the beaker.
<p><b>Running the experiment</b>
<p>First note the absorbance of the aqueous layer on the bottom of the window.  Add oil using the Extract menu option.  Click on the beaker to start the experiment.  The oil and water will be mixed and allowed to separate, and the final absorbance of the aqueous layer will be reported at the bottom of the screen.  The extraction may be repeated by using the Extract menu option to add more oil.  For example, students may wish to compare the efficiency of 1 100-mL extraction versus 4 25-mL extractions.
