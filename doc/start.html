<p>Using GenChemLab
<p>There are three menus when you start the program:
<li>the file menu,
<li>the experiment selection menu, and
<li>the help menu.
<p>The file menu is always available.  The file menu allows you to start a new experiment, close the current experiment, or close the program entirely.
<p>When the program is first started, select an experiment from the selection menu.  This menu will be replaced by a menu specific to the experiment.
<p>The help menu is always available.  The help menu opens general help, help for each experiment, and also displays program information.
