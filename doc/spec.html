<p><b>Spectrophotometry lab</b>
<p>The spectrophotometry lab simulates the absorbance of various colored solutions.
<p><b>Setup</b>
<p>The Spectrophotometry menu provides three options.  The first option sets the wavelength in nanometers.  Note that the instrument operates over the range from 200 nm to 800 nm.  The wavelength and absorbance are displayed on the status bar at the bottom.
<p>The second menu option scans the sample in the range from 390 nm to 740 nm.  The results are displayed on screen and in a comma-separated list for easy graphing.
<p>The third menu option is for sample preparation.  Dissolve an amount of salt in water to prepare the solution.  An amount will be transferred to the cell in the center of the screen for analysis. The simulated cell is 1 cm path length.
