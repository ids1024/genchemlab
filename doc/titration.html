<p><b>Titration lab</b>
<p>The Titration lab features a buret, beaker, and virtual pH meter.  The amount of liquid dispensed and the pH are automatically tracked and displayed on the status bar.
<p><b>Setup</b>
<p>The Titration menu offers the option for experiment setup.  
<p>The first option allows you to select a reagent to put in the buret.  The buret has infinite capacity and only need to be filled once.  
<p>A dialog will open with three functions.  The first section is to put reagents to titrate in the beaker.  You should select a reagent, enter a mass to use, and eneter the amount of water used to dissolve the reagent.  Your lab manual should specify the amount of reagent to use, and the amount of water in which to dissolve it.  The second function adds reagent to the buret; the buret will dispenase an unlimited volume, even if the beaker cannot hold it!  The third function adds an indictor, but you may select "none" if you are titrating by pH.  Click OK when finished setting up.
<p><b>Running the epxeriment</b>
<p>Click on the stopcock and drag down.  The buret will begin draining into the beaker.  The further down the screen you drag the pointer, the faster the flow rate.  Release the mouse button to stop the buret.  You can stop and start the buret as often as needed.  The amount dispensed and the pH are displayed at the bottom of the window.
